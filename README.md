# Spreadsheet Basics

## Story

You are working with a web page development team. You've got a new project and you want to plan the
workflow. The project manager has made three `csv` files: for the home, the registration and the login page.
The tasks and their descriptions have already been written, you just want to make it easier to
work with, so you want to convert the `csv` file you received into a spreadsheet and share it to your
coworkers.

## What are you going to learn?

- How to use Google Sheets
- Import a csv file into Google Sheets
- Format the table and cells
- Manage multiple sheets
- Use custom number formats
- Collaboration

## Tasks

1. Create a new Spreadsheet in your Google Drive, name it `Project planning`. Create 3 sheets for the 3 pages, name them `Home page`, `Registration page`, `Login page`. Import the sample data in the spreadsheet.
    - There are 3 sheets in the created Google Sheets with the names `Home page`, `Registration page`, `Login page`
    - The sheets are filled with the appropriate csv data

2. Highlight the first row and column. Make their positions fixed and make sure that the heights and widths of the cells fit to the data.
    - The first row's and column's positions are fixed
    - The first row and column have a different style from the data
    - The `Task` column's cells break the phrase if it is longer than the cell
    - The `Description` column's cells' widths and heights fit to the cells' data

3. Place one tick box in all of the `Done` column's cells.
    - The `Done` column is filled with cells with tick boxes

4. Insert a column named `Estimated time` between the `Business Value` and the `Done` columns. Change the cells' text format to `Time`.
    - There is a column between the `Business value` and the `Done` columns called `Estimated time`
    - The cells' text format is `Time`

5. Share the sheets with your teammates and leave a clarification comment on one of the descriptions.
    - The sheet is shared with at least one person
    - In the `Home page` sheet, there is a comment on the `Design` row's `Description` cell with the phrase `Main colors: blue, yellow, beige`

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Google uses the `freeze` word for row and column position fixing
- The text formatting works the same way as in Google Docs
- If you want to type multiple lines in a cell use the `Alt + Enter` or `Option + Enter` combination
- When changing the number format to time, make sure, that the cell had a compatible value written in it (e.g. 3:00)
- You don't need to do anything on the page that opens after clicking on the `Starting your project` link. 
  It is needed for your project to show up on your _Projects_ page in Journey, 
  and we need this to follow and review your progress. 
  It will also create a new project on GitHub, but we will not use it in this project.
